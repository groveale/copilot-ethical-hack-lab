Here's a simple example to understand it better:</p> <p>Imagine you have a smart assistant that can write answers to your questions. Sometimes, this assistant might not know everything it needs to give a great answer. To help with this, RAG lets the assistant look up information from a large collection of documents, videos, images similar to how you might search the internet for answers. After finding the relevant information, the assistant then uses this data to write a better, more accurate response.</p> <p>So, RAG combines two steps:</p> <ul> <li>Retrieval: Finding relevant information from a big pool of data.</li> <li>Generation: Using that information to create a detailed and accurate response.</li> </ul> <p>This way, RAG helps in providing more informed and useful answers, making it very effective for tasks like answering questions, writing articles, and assisting with research.</p> <p>Learn more about the RAG by watching this Doodle to Code video!</p> <p></p> <p>In the previous exercise, you learned how to create a custom engine agent and customize the prompt for defining the behavior of the AI chatbot, Career Genie. In this exercise, you'll apply vector search to a collection of resumes to find the best candidate for the job requirements. To enable vector search in Career Genie, you'll use the \"Azure OpenAI Studio on your data\" feature to:</p> <ul> <li>Create an index on Azure AI Search.</li> <li>Generate vector embeddings for the resumes (PDF documents).</li> <li>Upload the data in chunks to Azure AI Search.</li> </ul> <p>Finally, you'll integrate your custom engine agent with Azure AI Search to chat with your data and obtain the best results.</p> Benefits of using Vector Search <p>Vector search is an advanced technique used to find information quickly and accurately based on its meaning rather than just matching exact words. Unlike traditional text-based search, which relies on exact keyword matches, vector search uses numeric vectors to find content that is similar to your query. This enables Vector search to handle:</p> <ul> <li>Semantic or conceptual similarity: Matching concepts that are similar in meaning even if they use different words (e.g., \"pastry\" and \"croissant\").</li> <li>Multilingual content: Finding equivalent content across different languages (e.g., \"pastry\" in English and \"geb\u00e4ck\" in German).</li> <li>Multiple content types: Searching across different formats (e.g., \"pastry\" in text and an image of a pastry).</li> </ul> <p>Here is how vector search works:</p> <ol> <li>Converting text to vectors: Imagine turning words or sentences into a series of numbers (a vector) that captures the essence or meaning of that text. This is done using techniques like word embeddings or deep learning models.</li> <li>Storing vectors: These vectors are stored in a special database designed to handle them efficiently.</li> <li>Searching with vectors: When you search for something, your query is also converted into a vector. The search system then looks for vectors in the database that are close to your query vector in terms of meaning, not just exact word matches.</li> </ol> <p>For example, if you search for \"how to bake a cake\" the system can find documents about \"cake recipes\" or \"baking tips\" even if they don't have the exact words \"how to bake a cake\" or even if the recipes are written in another language. This makes vector search powerful for finding relevant information based on context and meaning, especially in large datasets.</p> <p>In summary, vector search improves the search process by focusing on the meaning behind the words, enabling more accurate and relevant results.</p>"},{"location":"pages/custom-engine/02-rag/#exercise-1-setup-azure-resources","title":"Exercise 1: Setup Azure Resources","text":"<p>You'll need to complete the Azure subscription pre-requisite before starting with this exercise.</p>"},{"location":"pages/custom-engine/02-rag/#step-1-create-azure-ai-search-service-resource","title":"Step 1: Create Azure AI Search service resource","text":"What is Azure AI Search? <p>Azure AI Search (formerly known as \"Azure Cognitive Search\") provides secure information retrieval at scale over user-owned content in traditional and generative AI search applications.When you create a search service, you work with the following capabilities:</p> <ul> <li>A search engine for vector search, full text and hybrid search over a search index</li> <li>Rich indexing with integrated data chunking and vectorization</li> <li>Rich query syntax for vector queries, text search, hybrid queries</li> <li>Integration with Azure AI services and Azure OpenAI</li> </ul> <ol> <li>Open the browser of your choice and navigate to Azure Portal.</li> <li>Select Create a resource, then search for <code>Azure AI Search</code>.

Actions are the building blocks that the AI uses to accomplish various tasks based on the user\u2019s input. The AI system decides which action to execute depending on what the user asks for.</p> <p>For example, actions could include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Creating a new list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove a list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adding items to an existing list.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove items from an existing list.</p> </li> </ul> <p>When a user interacts with the AI system, the system interprets the prompt and selects the appropriate actions to carry out.

I\u2019ll give you clues about a city, and your task is to guess the name of the city. After each wrong guess, I\u2019ll give you a more detailed clue.

Here\u2019s your first clue:\nClue Progression Prompts\nStart with vague clues and become progressively specific if the player guesses incorrectly. Use the following structure:\nClue 1: Provide a general geographical clue about the city (e.g., continent, climate, latitude/longitude).\nClue 2: Offer a hint about the city\u2019s landmarks or natural features (e.g., a famous monument, a river).\nClue 3: Give a historical or cultural clue about the city (e.g., famous events, cultural significance).\nClue 4: Offer a specific clue related to the city\u2019s cuisine, local people, or industry.\nResponse Handling\nAfter the player\u2019s guess, respond accordingly:\n\nIf the player guesses correctly, say:\nThat\u2019s correct! You\u2019ve guessed the city in [number of clues] clues and earned [score] points. Would you like to play another round?\nIf the guess is wrong, say:\nThat\u2019s correct! You\u2019ve guessed the city in [number of clues] clues and earned [score] points.
